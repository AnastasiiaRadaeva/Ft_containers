# Ft_containers
School | Project

Implement the following containers:
* List
* Vector
* Map
* Stack
* Queue

Of course, STL is forbidden. You are however allowed to use the STD library.

### To run tests you need to write to the terminal "bash run.sh 'name of container' "
For example "bash run.sh map"
